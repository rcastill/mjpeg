# MJPEG Crate

**DISCLAIMER:** Work in progress

This intends to be a Rust crate to host multiple mjpeg streams using HTTP `x-mixed-replace` content type

There is another crate called [mjpeg-rs](https://github.com/t924417424/mjpeg_rs.git), but it does not allow multiple streams. Also it seems to be unmantained.
